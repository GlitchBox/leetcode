#a litte slower sql, this uses outer join in the first place and then selects from the table
Select p.project_id, round(avg(e.experience_years),2) as average_years
from Project as p, Employee as e
where p.employee_id = e.employee_id
group by p.project_id

#faster sql, this doesn't require outer joining like the solution above. It only selects the rows that have matching conditions in both tables
Select Project.project_id, round(avg(Employee.experience_years),2) as average_years
from Project inner join Employee 
on Project.employee_id = Employee.employee_id
group by Project.project_id
