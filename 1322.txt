# Write your MySQL query statement below

select distinct Ads.ad_id,

case 
    when ifnull(clickTable.clicked, 0) + ifnull(viewTable.viewed,0) > 0 then ROUND( ifnull(clickTable.clicked,0)/(ifnull(clickTable.clicked,0)+ifnull(viewTable.viewed, 0))*100, 2)
    else 0
end as ctr

from ( ( Ads left join 
    ( select ad_id, count(*) as clicked
    from Ads
    where action = 'Clicked'
    group by ad_id ) clickTable

order by ctr desc, ad_id asc

###the following solution doesn't require any subqueries and joins
# Write your MySQL query statement below
#NOTE: avg doesn't consider NULL values

select ad_id, ifnull( round( avg(
                                    case
                                        when action = 'Clicked' then 1

                                        else NULL
                                    end 
                                )*100
